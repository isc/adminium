Hi there,

Adminium add-on has just been installed by <%= @user.email %> on <%= @account.name %>, a Heroku application you both share.

Not heard about Adminium yet? It's a backend for your database to visualise and manipulate your database content (edition, export, import, search...).

You can connect and try Adminium anytime, just log in to the service through Heroku's secure authentication service with your existing Heroku account credentials.

Here is the link: https://www.adminium.io

Welcome on board!
